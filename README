This subversion repository contains sample projects and documentation related
computer sciences, mathematics and other scientific fields.

The codes and documents mostly written by Şenol Korkmaz <mail@senolkorkmaz.info>,
Sarı Çizmeli Mehmet Ağa (aka. John Doe) <scma@senolkorkmaz.info> and our contributors.

The documents written by a non-native English writer and codes written by non-professional coder,
so errors are inevitable. Please refer more technical and formal resources also.

This repository mostly focused on providing educational material, that's why we are trying to write
more simple code instead of more efficient but complex code.

Most of the material found in this repository is available under the terms of GNU licenses (GPL,LGLP,FDL),
and all others available under some other free software and documentation licenses.

This repository may also contain huge number of bugs and typos, please report them 
via e-mail to <mail@senolkorkmaz.info>.
We like to read e-mails, so you will make us happy if you send comments, or just "hello" to same mail address :).
