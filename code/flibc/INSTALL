This file will be a recipe for compiling flibc and using it within your applications.

Unfortunately we have not implemented all functions yet. Therefore this file have no

Nevertheless, you should be able to compile individual files with some effort and
with the help of saying a little prayer. If not, please feel free to make contact with us.
