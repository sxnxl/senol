This directory contains contributed implementations of some flibc functions.

Some of those implementations may already be included within flibc. If your code
included in this directory but not in flibc, please don't be offended, there are
lots of possible reasons for that. Probably an other implementation is already
included and in fact, there might no more seat in flibc bus for one spesific function.
Fortunately flibc is not only a bus, imagine it as a motorcade that contains
a contributors' bus which always has a seat for your implementation.

Please send your own implementations to Åženol Korkmaz <mail@senolkorkmaz.info>.

You may want to read the file HACKING to be informed about our coding convention.
It will be best if you don't treat the reader as an oracle and it will also be nice
if you treat him/her as an average developer who is using C language and Unix like 
operating system. Write your code and documentation as intended for such a reader.

Before sending contributions, consider that flibc is licensed under the terms of
GNU General Public License so we publish only GNU GPL compatible work.
Please provide the copyright and license notices along with your work.

In some cases I might make corrections to your contributions, and in most cases
i will use GNU Indent to make your code compatible with GNU Coding Guidelines.
