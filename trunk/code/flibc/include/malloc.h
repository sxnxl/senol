  The malloc routines and its friends (calloc, realloc, etc.) allocatest memory
  by using system call mmap(). The actual memory area that is obtained from system
  is in the chunk form that is figured below.

  Structure __meminfo is internally used by malloc routines
  to store information about dynamically allocated memory.

    .flags can be a combination of bits:
        __MEM_MALLOC
        __MEM_CALLOC
        __MEM_MEMALIGN

    .padding is used by aligned memory allocators to refer to the size
    of unused area that is at the beginning of the chunk.

    .alignment is used by aligned memory allocators to refer to the
    alignment of memory area.

    .size is used to refer the size of usable (requested) memory area
    that is allocated by dynamic memory allocators
