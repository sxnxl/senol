PREFACE
-------
flibc is an implementation of C Standard Library for educational purposes.
It is intended to be less portable and less optimised but more readable
implementation (or fake) of glibc (GNU C Library).

We choose the prefix 'f' to stand for the word "Fake".
You may also note that strcmp("flibc","glibc") returns less than zero :)

It is implemented for educational purposes to provide a simple to understand,
more readable and well documented implementation of C Standard Library.

We think that flibc may not be suitable for production environments.
There are already much of libraries suitable for productional purposes such as glibc,
and much of libraries suitable for embedded (poor resource) environments such as
eglibc and uClibc. You should consider using these libraries if you are planing to
use within a production environment or on embedded system.
