This subversion repository contains some projects and documentation that are related with
computer sciences, mathematics and other scientific fields.

The codes and documents mostly written by Åženol Korkmaz <mail@senolkorkmaz.info> and contributors.

The documents written by a non-native English writer and codes written by non-professional coder,
so errors are inevitable. Please refer more technical and formal resources also.

This repository mostly focused on providing educational material, that's why we are trying to write
more simple code instead of more efficient complex code.

Most of the material found in this repository is available under the terms of GNU licenses (GPL,LGLP,FDL),
